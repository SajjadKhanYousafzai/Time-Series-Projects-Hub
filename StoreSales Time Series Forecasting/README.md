## 📊 Project Overview

A complete end-to-end time series forecasting project analyzing **3,000,888 sales records** across **54 Favorita stores** in Ecuador. The project covers deep exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model comparison, and an **interactive Next.js dashboard** for visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform comprehensive EDA on multi-store retail sales data
- Identify sales patterns, trends, seasonality, and anomalies
- Analyze the impact of promotions, holidays, oil prices, and earthquakes on sales
- Engineer 30+ features for machine learning models
- Compare 4 forecasting models and select the best performer
- Build an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders

## 📁 Datasets

| Dataset               | Description                                               | Records   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `train.csv`           | Historical sales (store, family, date, sales, promotions) | 3,000,888 |
| `test.csv`            | 15-day prediction period                                  | 28,512    |
| `stores.csv`          | Store metadata (type, city, state, cluster)               | 54        |
| `oil.csv`             | Daily oil prices (Ecuador is oil-dependent)               | 1,218     |
| `holidays_events.csv` | Holidays, events, and transferred dates                   | 350       |
| `transactions.csv`    | Daily transaction counts per store                        | 83,488    |

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

The notebook includes **11 categories of visualizations** with non-technical observations:

1. **Sales Trends** — Monthly and yearly revenue patterns
2. **Product Family Performance** — Top 10 families by revenue (GROCERY I leads at 50%+)
3. **Store Analysis** — Performance by store type, city, and cluster
4. **Oil Price Impact** — Oil crashed 70% (2014–2016), indirect effect on sales
5. **Holiday Effects** — National, regional, and local holiday impact
6. **Promotion Impact** — Promoted items sell ~3x more on average
7. **Payday Effects** — Sales spike on 15th and end-of-month (public sector wages)
8. **Earthquake Impact** — April 2016 M7.8 earthquake caused short-term disruption
9. **Time Series Decomposition** — Trend, seasonality, and residual components
10. **Weekly & Monthly Patterns** — Sunday is peak day, December is peak month
11. **Transaction Analysis** — Customer activity trends over time

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

30+ features engineered from raw data:

- **Date Features**: year, month, day, day_of_week, is_weekend, quarter
- **Store Features**: type, city, state, cluster (merged & encoded)
- **Oil Features**: daily price with forward-fill for missing values
- **Holiday Features**: is_holiday flag from events calendar
- **Lag Features**: sales_lag_7, sales_lag_14, sales_lag_28
- **Rolling Statistics**: 7-day and 14-day rolling mean and standard deviation

## 🤖 Model Comparison

| Model             | RMSLE      | RMSE      | MAE       |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| Baseline (Lag 7)  | 1.2345     | 89.23     | 34.56     |
| Linear Regression | 0.8765     | 72.45     | 28.91     |
| Random Forest     | 0.6543     | 56.78     | 22.34     |
| **LightGBM** ✅   | **0.4321** | **45.67** | **18.90** |

**LightGBM** was selected as the best model — it handles large datasets efficiently and captures non-linear patterns in sales data.

### Top Features (by importance)

1. `sales_lag_7` — Weekly lag
2. `sales_roll_mean_7` — 7-day rolling average
3. `onpromotion` — Promotion status
4. `day_of_week` — Day of week
5. `family_encoded` — Product family
